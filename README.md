Here I am going to show you how to plot the tree visual of Random forest model
The choice between logistic regression and random forest for a specific problem depends on several factors, including the nature of the problem, the size and quality of the data, and the specific requirements for the solution.

Logistic Regression is a simple and efficient model that is well suited for problems with a small number of features and a linear relationship between the features and the outcome. It is also easy to interpret, as the coefficients of the independent variables provide insight into the relationship between each feature and the outcome.

Random Forest, on the other hand, is a more complex model that is well suited for problems with a large number of features, a non-linear relationship between the features and the outcome, or a large amount of noise in the data. Random forest is also more flexible and can handle a mix of continuous and categorical variables, missing values, and outliers.
